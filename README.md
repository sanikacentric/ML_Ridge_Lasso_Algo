A Technical Guide to Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) Regularization in Linear Regression
Regularization is a fundamental technique in machine learning used to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. Two of the most widely used regularization techniques in linear regression are Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2). This article provides a detailed technical overview of both methods, explaining their mathematical formulations, use cases, and benefits.
Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
Lasso regression enhances the standard linear regression model by introducing an L1 penalty term, which adds the absolute values of the model coefficients to the cost function:
J(θ) = (1/2m) ∑ (ŷ(i) - y(i))^2 + λ ∑ |θj|
- ŷ(i): Predicted value
- y(i): Actual value
- λ: Regularization hyperparameter controlling the penalty
- |θj|: Absolute value of the jth coefficient
Feature Selection Advantage
The L1 norm encourages sparse solutions by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. This leads to an automatic feature selection mechanism, making Lasso highly effective when working with high-dimensional data.
Example:
Given the model:
ŷ = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x2 + θ3x3 + ...
The L1 penalty becomes:
λ (|θ1| + |θ2| + |θ3| + ...)
Features associated with small or insignificant θj values may be reduced to zero, effectively removing them from the model.
Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
Ridge regression modifies the cost function by introducing an L2 penalty, which adds the squared values of the coefficients:
J(θ) = (1/2m) ∑ (ŷ(i) - y(i))^2 + λ ∑ θj^2
Unlike Lasso, Ridge does not reduce coefficients to exactly zero. Instead, it shrinks them towards zero, maintaining all features in the model but with reduced magnitude.
Overfitting Control
Ridge is most beneficial when all input features are believed to be relevant, and the goal is to control the complexity of the model and reduce variance.
Key Differences and Use Cases
| Technique        | Penalty Type     | Effect on Coefficients | Feature Elimination | Best Use 
| Ridge (L2)       | θ^2              | Shrinks values          | No                  | When all features are potentially useful   |

| Lasso (L1)       | |θ|              | Shrinks and eliminates  | Yes                 | When only some features are significant    |
Hyperparameter Tuning with Lambda (λ)
The regularization strength λ determines how aggressively the coefficients are penalized:
- Large λ: Strong regularization, smaller coefficients.
- Small λ: Weak regularization, model behaves like ordinary least squares.
Cross-validation is used to choose the optimal λ that minimizes prediction error on unseen data.
Practical Guidelines
1. Try both Lasso and Ridge to evaluate which performs better on your dataset.
2. Use performance metrics such as:
   - R-squared (R²): Proportion of variance explained.
   - Adjusted R-squared: Penalizes model complexity.
   - RMSE or MAE: Measures prediction error.
3. Consider Elastic Net if you want the benefits of both L1 and L2.
Summary
| Method           | Prevents Overfitting | Performs Feature Selection | Use Case                              |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Ridge Regression | ✅                    | ❌                          | All features matter                    |
| Lasso Regression | ✅                    | ✅                          | Sparse model with key predictors       |
Conclusion
Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques are powerful tools for improving model generalization and interpretability. Ridge is best for controlling overfitting without eliminating features, while Lasso is ideal when feature selection is also a priority. Proper tuning of the regularization parameter λ using cross-validation is essential to get optimal results in practice.
